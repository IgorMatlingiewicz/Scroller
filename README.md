# Scroller
Small Scroller site project made with JavaScript.<br>
Main function is about scrolling only from one block to another, and one block covers full screen.<br>
Pictures and text on site are generating randomly, because main purpose of site is about scroller function.<br>
There also are four dots to help navigate on right side of screen to show which block of this site are you currently looking at.<br>

# Screenshots
Screen shows one of 4 blocks of site. I edited this image to show where navigation exactly is.
